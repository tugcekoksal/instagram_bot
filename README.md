# instagram_bot




What do you need??
* Python
* Selenium
* A Browser(i used Chrome)
* An Instagram Account


HI EVERYONE!!!
If you want to build new followers who are relavant to you and share common interests with you, this instagram bot is for you! I’ve planed this bot to lookup specific hashtags and interact with the photos there. This way, I can be very specific about what kind of interests I want my audience to have. I dont use it for my personal account but for my healthy food account it worked great.For instance, I really like to learn new healthy recipes, so I can target people who use that 'healthy food' hashtags and build an audience around this kind of content. Simple and efficient!

So, how do i interact with others??
* First Instagram_Bot will login your account (dont forget to import your user informations from another file)
* Then it will open the pages from your hashtag list and click on the first picture on the page. It will then like, follow, comment and move to the next picture, in a 100 iterations loop (number can be adjusted)
* and saves a list with all users followed

To use Chrome with selenium you need to download chromedriver and set the path. You can check the link below, it is very simple: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/getting-started

I also have unfollow function and using it once per week to unfollow the users i lately followed. I created new user list, because i want to keep my base following list, and unfollow the users the bot followed.
I’m not using this bot intensively, as Instagram will stop responding if you run it too fast. It needs to have some sleep commands in between the actions, because after some comments and follows in a short period of time, Instagram stops responding and the bot crashes.
Enjoy !!
